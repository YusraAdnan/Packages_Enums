         * === Activity Instructions === 
         * 1. Create a package called com.company.HelperClasses
         
         * 2. Inside this package, create two files:
         *    - An enum called YearLevel with values FIRST_YEAR, SECOND_YEAR, THIRD_YEAR.
         *    - A class called Student with fields:
         *         String name
         *         YearLevel using enum
         *         displayInfo() method.
         *
         * 3. In displayInfo():
         *     use the enums demo to example to print out student details like this for each year:
         *     "Student: Aisha enrolled in: 1st Year"

         *
         * 4. - Create an ArrayList of Student in the main
         *    - Add at least 3 Student objects, each with a different YearLevel.
         *    - Use the ArrayList example we did to see how we can add an object to an array list
         *    - Use the ArrayList example to also see how we can print out objects in array lists
         *
         * 5. Run your program. The output should list each studentâ€™s name
         *    with their correct year (1st, 2nd, or 3rd Year).
         *
